Function: fill_missing_values(subset, metric)
- subset: subset takes a column or a list of column labels. Its default value is []. When passing in the columns, the function will only consider them for filling in missing values.

    - If 'mean', it fills in the missing values of a column by that column mean value.
    - If 'median', it fills in the missing values of a column by that column median value.
    - If 'mode', it fills in the missing values of a column by that column mode value.
